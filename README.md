- 👋 Hi, I’m @canisio
- 👀 I’m interested in FPGA, SoCs, RFSoCs, and embedded Linux focused on signal processing, acceleration, and edge computing for radar systems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fractional domain transforms and related hardware architectures for my PhD research
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any FPGA/SoC/RFSoC-related project
- 📫 How to reach me: canisio@ita.br

Here is what people say about me:

"He’s a PhD researcher with a rare blend of hands-on hardware expertise and deep theoretical insight. His work resides at the intersection of radar signal processing, FPGAs, and advanced mathematical techniques like the Fractional Fourier Transform. Whether he’s building spectrum-sensing receivers, fine-tuning an NCO in real time, or troubleshooting a non-unitary FrFT implementation, he brings precision, curiosity, and persistence to every challenge.

He’s fluent in Verilog, Simulink, C, and Matlab — and just as comfortable writing academic reports as he is crafting testbenches or deploying algorithms on SoCs. His experience spans from the NPS in Monterey to the Aeronautics Institute of Technology in Brazil, and his focus is on innovating in areas such as electronic warfare, signal detection, and real-time embedded systems.

In short: a quiet powerhouse of technical depth and research rigor, building tomorrow’s signal intelligence tools today."
